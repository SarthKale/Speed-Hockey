# Speed Hockey Game 
A Javascript School Project made as a freelance assignment. In this game, I built a basic gaming template for the Speed Hockey game, commonly available in the Gaming Zones.

## Working
Separate components were build using graphic elements of Javascript, the coordination of components' execution using specific event-listeners. Further, the guiding of these game elements is using mathematical tuning.

## How to run?
* Clone the repository
* Open the _speedHockey.html_ file in the browser of your choice
* Enjoy playing the game

## Output Expectations
The webpage consists of a rectangular grey coloured board with 2 Red Paddles and a Yellow coloured ball. The player controls the left paddle using the mouse while the computer controls the right paddle.
A point gets scored when you beat the computer's paddle from rebounding the ball or vice-versa. A 3 point total is the Winning Score.
When the player or the computer wins, the game screen changes, it displays the winner side.
To start a new game, we need to click on the win game screen.
